- Looks for patterns matching financial data
- **Nothing leaves your device yet**

### Step 2: Secure Analysis

## 🔒 Your Privacy is Protected

### What We Store:
✅ "Device has 3 vulnerabilities"
✅ "Types: credit_card, ssn, screenshot"
✅ "Recommendations: Delete screenshot, encrypt file"

### What We NEVER Store:
❌ Your actual credit card numbers
❌ Your SSN
❌ Your bank account numbers
❌ Any real financial data

**Think of it like antivirus software:**
- It scans for threats
- It tells you what it found
- It helps you fix it
- **It doesn't steal your data**

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Real Risks:
1. **Data Breaches**: If someone hacks your device, exposed financial data = instant theft
2. **Family Access**: Kids or roommates can accidentally see/use saved credit cards
3. **Cloud Backups**: Screenshots with financial info automatically backed up to iCloud/Google = wider exposure
4. **Email Hacks**: Emails with financial docs = hacker's goldmine

### Real Savings:
1. **Subscription Waste**: Average person pays for 5 subscriptions, only uses 2
2. **Delivery Addiction**: $800/month on delivery = $9,600/year wasted
3. **Impulse Buying**: Small purchases add up to $4,000+/year
4. **Better Awareness**: Just knowing your spending = 25% reduction
