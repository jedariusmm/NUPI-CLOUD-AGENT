# 🎉 AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM DEPLOYED!

## ✅ WHAT'S LIVE NOW

**NUPI Cloud Agent is now FULLY AUTONOMOUS!**

The system automatically:
- 🚀 **Auto-deploys** agents to new devices (no manual setup!)
- 📊 **Monitors** all devices 24/7 (CPU, RAM, Disk, Battery)
- ⚡ **Optimizes** performance automatically when usage is low
- 🧹 **Cleans** storage when disk gets full
- 🧠 **Predicts** issues before they happen (trend analysis)
- 🏥 **Self-heals** offline/stuck agents automatically

## 🎮 HOW TO USE

### 1️⃣ Queue Device for Auto-Deployment
```bash
curl -X POST https://nupi-cloud-agent.up.railway.app/api/autonomous/queue-device \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user123",
    "deviceId": "johns-macbook",
    "deviceType": "desktop"
  }'
```

**That's it!** System will:
- ✅ Deploy agent automatically
- ✅ Send installation instructions
- ✅ Start monitoring when agent connects
- ✅ Optimize based on usage patterns

### 2️⃣ Check System Status
